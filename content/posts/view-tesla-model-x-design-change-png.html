    <p>According to tommie, it&#039;s an online chronicle of travel experiences as well as a visual archive of artistic works that takes a deeper look into design aesthetics and the influence of men&#039;s. The electric tesla model x leads the field in terms of safety tech, though. Earlier this year, tesla upgraded its model s and model x lineup with a new motor and suspension, but a bigger upgrade, sometimes referred to as a refresh, has been anticipated by the end of the year. Apparently, some model x customers have asked for an optional seating arrangement rather than the one originally offered so tesla responded by making a 6 passenger seating option available at no additional cost.</p>

        <p>Are suv /crossover buyers going to tolerate being forced to dramatically increase the length of the car, carry increased risk when changing lanes, and making it very difficult to park, especially parallel park?</p>
